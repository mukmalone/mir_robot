# API End Points #

### API Server URL ###
http://192.168.2.238:3001/
- API is under development and deployed locally.  It will be available for free use to open source developers in the upcoming future.

### Response object ###
All endpoints return the same JSON object.  Depending on the request, some fields may just be their default value.

`{
    status: '0', name: '', sourceName: '', sourceX: '', sourceY: '', sourceW: '',
    destinationName: '', destinationX: '', destinationY: '', destinationW: ''
}
`

The ROS service which implements the endpoints in ROS has the following server definition:
- name: WebComm.srv
- Request:
> - string function //name of function you want to call(defined below)
> - string name //name of the robot making the request
> - string location //used when moving to source or destination locations
---
- Response:
> - uint32 status //status of the request.  PASS=1 Error Code is != 1
> - string name  //returns the name of the robot, if there is an error this will be the error description
> - string tools // returns the list of tools associated with the destination station
> - string program // returns the list of programs associated with the destination station
> - string poNum // returns the PO number of the part being run
> - string partNumber // returns the part number of the part being run
> - string partSerialNumber: // returns the serial number of the part being run
> - string sourceName //Source Workstation name
> - uint32 sourcePosX //Source workstation parking X location
> - uint32 sourcePosY //Source workstation parking Y location
> - uint32 sourcePosZ //Source workstation parking Z location
> - uint32 sourceOrientX //Source workstation parking X angle
> - uint32 sourceOrientY //Source workstation parking Y angle
> - uint32 sourceOrientZ //Source workstation parking Z angle
> - uint32 sourceOrientW //Source workstation parking angle
> - string destinationName //Destination workstation name
> - uint32 destPosX //Destination workstation parking X location
> - uint32 destPosY //Destination workstation parking Y location
> - uint32 destPosZ //Destination workstation parking Z location
> - uint32 destOrientX //Destination workstation parking X angle
> - uint32 destOrientY //Destination workstation parking Y angle
> - uint32 destOrientZ //Destination workstation parking Z angle
> - uint32 destOrientW //Destination workstation parking angle

### /workerGetNextJob ###
curl: http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerGetNextJob?name=your-robot-name-goes-here
- Function: NEXTJOB
- Description: This curl will check if there is an available job for the robot corresponding to the robot name.  If there is it will return the source and destination name and coordinates

### /workerActivateJob ###
curl:  http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerActivateJob?name=your-robot-name-goes-here
- Function: ACTIVATEJOB
- Description: This curl will acknowledge the job is received and that the robot has started the job

### /workerLocation ###
curl:  http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerLocation?name=your-robot-name-goes-here&location=source-or-desination-goes-here
- Function: MOVEWORKER
- Description: This curl will update the location of the worker to be either at the source or destination workstation
- Implementation: in the `location` field `source` is used to acknowledge worker is at the source workstation, `destination` is used to acknowlegde the worker is at the destination station

### /workerTakePart ###
curl:  http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerTakePart?name=your-robot-name-goes-here
- Function: TAKEPART
- Description: This curl will acknowledge the worker has retrieved the part from the `source` workstation

### /workerLoadWorkstation ###
curl:  http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerLoadWorkstation?name=your-robot-name-goes-here
- Function: LOADPART
- Description: This curl will acknowledge the worker has loaded the part into the `destination` workstation

### /workerArchiveJob ###
curl:  http://192.168.2.238:3001/workerLoadWorkstation?name=your-robot-name-goes-here
- Function: ARCHIVEJOB
- Description: This curl will clear the worker job and signal it is ready for the next job (call NEXTJOB)
